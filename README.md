#SET-COMMAND-INTERPRETER-v2.0
*SetCommandInterpreter* is a shell/terminal that supports set operations.
This application allows you to work with sets.
##*NOTE: All sets work with integers only*


#UPDATES
1. Bugs in SetCommandInterpreter-v1.0 fixed
2. Enhanced security of data
3. Updated exception handling mechanism
4. Added feature of command history


#SUPPORTED COMMANDS
The following commands are supported by the application:
1) To add integers to pre-existing set, we use
	add <set_name> <integer1> <integer2> <integer3> ...
	e.g. 
	/home/shailly:~$ add set1 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100
2) To clear the shell/terminal, we use
    clear
	e.g. 
	/home/shailly:~$ clear
3) To clear a pre-existing set (delete its all elements), we use
	clear <set1_name> <set2_name> <set3_name> ...
	e.g. 
	/home/shailly:~$ clear set1 set2
4) Test for existence of integer in a pre-existing set
	contains <set_name> <integer1> <integer2> <integer3> ...
	e.g. 
	/home/shailly:~$ contains set1 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100
5) To save the changes to database, we use commit command
	commit
	e.g. 
	/home/shailly:~$ commit
	Note that your work isn't saved unless you commit it!!
6) To delete a pre-existing set, we use
	del <set_name>
	e.g. 
	/home/shailly:~$ del set1
7) To delete specific elements in a pre-existing set, we use
	del <set_name> <integer1> <integer2> <integer3> ...
	e.g. 
	/home/shailly:~$ del set1 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100
8) To delete all sets, we use
	delall
	e.g. 
	/home/shailly:~$ delall
9) To exit from terminal, we use
	exit
	e.g. 
	/home/shailly:~$ exit
10) To get the details of command, we use
	help
	e.g. 
	/home/shailly:~$ exit
11) To get the insersection of sets, we use
	int <result_set> <set1_name> <set2_name> ...
	e.g. 
	/home/shailly:~$ int set4 set1 set2 set3
	set4 = int(set1,set2,set3)
12) To get a list of all sets, we use
	ls
	e.g. 
	/home/shailly:~$ ls
13) To make set(s), we use
	mkset <set1_name> <set2_name> <set3_name> ...
	e.g. 
	/home/shailly:~$ mkset set1 set2 set3 set4
14) To display the content of pre-existing set(s), we use
	print <set1_name> <set2_name> <set3_name> ...
	e.g. 
	/home/shailly:~$ print set1 set2 set3
15) To rename a pre-existing set, we use
	rnm <old_set_name> <new_set_name>
	e.g. 
	/home/shailly:~$ rnm set1 new_set1
16) To get the cardinality of pre-existing set(s), we use
	size <set1_name> <set2_name> <set3_name> ...
	/home/shailly:~$ size set1 set2 set3
17) To get the union of sets, we use
	union <result_set> <set1_name> <set2_name> ...
	/home/shailly:~$ union set3 set1 set2
	set3 = union(set1, set2)
